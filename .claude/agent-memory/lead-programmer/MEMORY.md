# Lead Programmer — Agent Memory

## Skill Authoring Conventions

### Frontmatter
- Fields: `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`
- Read-only analysis skills that run in isolation also carry `context: fork` and `agent:`
- Interactive skills (write files, ask questions) do NOT use `context: fork`
- `AskUserQuestion` is a usage pattern described in skill body text — it is NOT listed
  in `allowed-tools` frontmatter (no existing skill does this)

### File Layout
- Skills live in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (subdirectory per skill, never flat .md)
- Section headers use `##` for phases, `###` for sub-sections
- Phase names follow "Phase N: Verb Noun" pattern (e.g., "Phase 1: Find the Story")
- Output format templates go in fenced code blocks

### Known Canonical Paths (verify before referencing in new skills)
- Tech debt register: `docs/tech-debt-register.md` (NOT `production/tech-debt.md`)
- Sprint files: `production/sprints/`
- Epic story files: `production/epics/[epic-slug]/story-[NNN]-[slug].md`
- Control manifest: `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`
- Session state: `production/session-state/active.md`
- Systems index: `design/gdd/systems-index.md`
- Engine reference: `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md`

### Skills Completed
- `story-done` — end-of-story completion handshake (Phase 1-8, writes story file)

## Working Style
- [Large design docs: write first, grep on demand](feedback_large_design_docs.md) — don't read 3400-line specs linearly; a passing generator beats the prose.

## Axie Dice Tactics
- [Verification baselines & harness gotchas](project_axiedice_verification.md) — harness file lists, soak needs build/, serve.py is broken, soakm flake is pre-existing.
